## 💊 Project Overview
This dashboard recreates and visualizes **Robert Burtin’s 1951 classic experiment** measuring the  
**minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)** of three antibiotics across 16 bacterial species:  

- **Penicillin**  
- **Streptomycin**  
- **Neomycin**

**Key concept:**  
- Lower MIC ⇒ more potent (less needed to inhibit growth)  
- MIC ≤ 1 µg/mL ⇒ bacteria considered **highly sensitive**  

The dashboard allows users to filter by **antibiotic type** and **Gram stain** classification, while highlighting where drug resistance emerges.
